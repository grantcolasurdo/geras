You can get a sample of blood from any weapon that has damaged the target in combat. When you first cast the spell, you will know if the target is within a mile of you and if so, what direction. This lasts for 10 minutes and you can keep it active for 2 MP per further 10 minutes. While the spell is active, you will know what direction the target is from you. This acts like a beacon but the spell has no intelligence behind it.

For the remainder of the encounter, you can give part or all of this bonus to an ally within 20 yards of you if it would make one of their failed ability tests into a success. If an ally failed a test by 2, for example, you could give them 2 of your total bonus to make that into a success. The GM must tell you the cost and you can then decide if you want to apply any of your bonus to the test. Hands of fate lasts until you?ve spent your total bonus, or the encounter ends. If your total bonus from casting the spell was 5, for example, you might give 3 of it to one ally and later give 2 to another.

For the remainder of the encounter, you and your allies within 10 yards of you may re-roll your Stunt Die when generating stunt points and take the better result.

Ensnaring Roots,"Tough, gnarled roots spring up from the ground to grab and entangle targets in a 4 yard by 4 yard area within 20 yards of you that you designate. Those affected must make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test against your Spellpower. Failure means the target is trapped and rooted to that spot for the duration of the encounter (though they can fire ranged weapons, cast spells, and take other actions that do not involve moving). Trapped targets can make a Strength (Might) check against your Spellpower as a major action to tear free of the ensnaring roots. Anyone moving through the area affected by the spell has a ?5 penalty to speed.",Wood,Journeyman,Attack,8,8,Major Action,11
Awaken Tree,"You ?awaken? a mature tree within 10 yards of you, giving it senses, awareness, and movement. It becomes the equivalent of an ogre (see Chapter 9: Adversaries; use the maul attack to represent attacks from the tree?s branches). It is friendly to you and obedient to your commands for the duration of the encounter. At the end of the spell, the tree reverts to its normal form, putting down roots wherever it is standing.",Wood,Master,Utility,15,15,Major Action,15
