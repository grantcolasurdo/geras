Artist,Lower,"Beauty drives you. It?s really all that matters. Whether beauty takes the shape of a painting, a sonnet, a sculpture, or something else entirely doesn?t matter. The fact that it?s beautiful and, most importantly, you made it, does. You?ve either apprenticed with another artist, perhaps in a studio with other wouldbe artists, or you have exceptional natural talent. Regardless, you likely specialize in a particular form of art. Now you just need to figure out how to make a living at it. ",Cultrual Lore,Evaluation
Criminal,Outsider,"You make your living on the streets. More accurately, you make your living off other people walking the streets.

You know how to spot a house worth robbing. You also know, if you?re caught, you?re dead.",Deception,Lock Picking
Dilettante,Upper,"Being wealthy has afforded you opportunities to indulge in the best of life. You study what interests you, you wear whatever?s in fashion, you drink fine wines and eat refined foods, you have the most interesting friends, and you?re always on the lookout for the next bit of gossip. Life is fine, indeed. You may revel in your role as a member of the upper crust, or you may be the black sheep of your family. Ultimately what matters is that you?re never bored.",Gambling,Drinking
Exile,Outsider,"You are a true outcast. Wherever you?re from, you or your family did something that resulted in you being exiled. Perhaps you were on the wrong side of a war, had the wrong friends at the wrong time, made some business dealings that didn?t end well, or simply broke some very taboo laws. Whatever it was, you?ve lived on the road for a while, perhaps years, and know how to make your way in the world.",Bargaining,Cultural Lore
Guilder,Middle,"You work for one of the powerful mercantile or craft guilds that control trade in the larger cities.

Hermit,Outsider,"You left civilization for some reason to become a hermit. Perhaps you took a holy vow, perhaps you needed time alone to ponder an important question or remove yourself from a difficult situation, or perhaps you just don?t care for people and are happy to be on your own.

Innkeeper,Middle,"You run or work at an inn. You know what?s needed to keep an inn running and the customers happy, or at least happy enough to pay you for services rendered.

Merchant,Middle,"You have a way with people and you use that in your business dealings to become successful. You use your charisma to get the best deals or to convince others they?re getting the best deal, but all in service to your success. You may have a small merchant stand selling odds and ends in a bazaar or operate a thriving shop that specializes in carpets, foreign imports, or other valuables. Instead of a store, perhaps you travel from one place to another, buying unusual items in one place and transporting them to sell in another. Regardless of the type of merchant you are, you know how to come out ahead in any deal.",Bargaining,Deception
Noble,Upper,"You were born a noble and raised to believe not only that you?re naturally superior to everyone of a lower station, but that it was your role to take care of them as you would children who have no idea how to get by in the world. Some may call you snooty, but doing so only reveals their ignorance. You?ve always enjoyed the best in life and that is as it should be.

Pirate,Outsider,"You may not have been born on the water, but you call it home now. Any city you visit is merely a brief stop before heading back out to sea to find more ships to prey on.

Others may change the course of history, but you?re the one who tells them how to do it.",Historical Lore,Religious Lore
Scribe,Middle,"Books, scrolls, and portfolios are what you fill your time with.

You?ve trained for combat, but also had an education in how to live and work as part of a unit as well as how to take and execute an order. A soldier who doesn?t follow orders is useless.

Squire,Upper,"There are many knights in the world and all of them need help taking care of their mounts, cleaning their armor, sharpening weapons, and doing whatever else the knight asks.

Student,Middle,"Rather than spend your life making goods, fixing them, or selling them, you are one of the few wealthy, connected, or smart enough to attend a university.
